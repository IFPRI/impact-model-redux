title: IMPACT Baseline Water

Latest release of estimates for water parameters from the baseline suite of scenarios of the IFPRI International Model for Policy Analysis of Agricultural Commodities and Trade (IMPACT). The simulations run up to the year 2050, under assumptions of constant climate, or under a range of climate change scenarios. 

METHODOLOGY
The International Model for Policy Analysis of Agricultural Commodities and Trade (IMPACT) is typically used to perform scenario analysis in order to evaluate the effect of policy and technological choices on food supply and demand, trade and food security outcomes. A suite of baseline scenarios provides a reference point to estimate the consequences of changes in a number of inputs and drivers (e.g., changes in area or yield growth rates, etc). The baseline water data presented here are the result of a major update in the release of the IMPACT model. The new baseline suite of scenarios is built around the SSP2 Shared Socioeconomic Pathway under 5 different possible climate change futures. SSP2 represents a middle of the road projection for population and GDP. The five climates that are used with SSP2 are NoCC, GFDL, MIROC, and HADGEM. NoCC represents the effects of historical climate going into the future. The others represent various Global Circulation Models (GCMs).

The IMPACT model is a partial equilibrium, multi–commodity, multi-country model which generates projections of global food supply, demand, trade, and prices. In IMPACT, each country is linked to the rest of the world through international trade and demand is a function of prices, income, and population growth. Crop production is determined by crop and input prices, the rate of productivity growth, and water availability.
