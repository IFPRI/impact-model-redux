## what is on this brief and how to interpret the results ##
The brief shows highlights from global and regional IMPACT results estimating the effects of alternative investments options on agriculture production, trade and food security.

## Source project & acknowledgments ##
The Global Futures and [Strategic Foresight program](http://globalfutures.cgiar.org/project-overview/) recently released a study using quantitative foresight modeling to explore the effects of alternative investments options (in agricultural research, resource management, and infrastructure) on the 3 goals underpinning the [Strategy framework of the CGIAR](http://www.cgiar.org/our-strategy/). These three goals, also called System Level Outcomes SLOs), relate to poverty (SLO1), food and nutrition security (SLO2), and natural resources and ecosystem services (SLO3). Impacts on these goals to 2050 were analyzed in the context of overarching trends related to changes in population, income, technology, and climate. The report is intended to help the CGIAR centers, CG Research Programs (CRPs), decision makers and donors to complement other efforts and assess the potential impacts and benefits of long-term investment strategies toward agricultural research and development. 
The analysis was led by IFPRI with contributions from colleagues in all 15 CGIAR Centers and other institutions, and with financial support from the United States Agency for International Development, the CGIAR Research Program on Policies, Institutions, and Markets (PIM), the CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS), and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.

In this brief we show results from the IMPACT model. These results are informed by a link with the GLOBE global general equilibrium model. The study uses other models – linked to IMPACT - to explore questions related to SLO3, especially land use changes and greenhouse gas emissions. It also includes an estimation of costs for the various investment alternatives, and it goes beyond an analysis of food supply to assess nutrition outcomes. The complete set of results and analysis are available by downloading the full report (in pdf format) at [this page](https://www.ifpri.org/publication/foresight-modeling-agricultural-research).

## Use of the IMPACT model & notes on methodology ##
#### Test dimension ####
The IMPACT model is a partial equilibrium, multi–commodity, multi-country model which generates projections of global food supply, demand, trade, and prices (link to about page). IMPACT is designed to analyze alternative scenarios about how population, income, climate and technologies may change over time. Usually, a suite of baseline scenarios provides a reference point to estimate the consequences of changes in a number of inputs and drivers (e.g., changes in yields, population, GDP etc). 
The reference scenario (REF_HGEM) used in this analysis as a reference for comparison with alternative investment portfolios assumes “middle-of-the-road” changes in population and income, and rapid climate change. These assumptions are based on the IPCC’s Shared Socioeconomic Pathway 2 (SSP2), in which the global population reaches 9.2 billion by 2050 with an average income of USD 25,000 per person. The projected climate is generated on the Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 (RCP8.5), as modeled by the HadGEM general circulation model (GCM). At times, also a reference without climate change (REF_NoCC) is used to isolate the effects of climate from the effects of the investments. NoCC represents a historical climate around the year 2005, projected into the future. Key areas of investment considered in the scenarios are agricultural research, water resource management, and infrastructure.
The full set of scenarios, including the full range of investment scenarios are summarized in the table below.
